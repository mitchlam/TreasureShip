************************************************************************************

We should put our ideas about what we want to do and how we want to make it here.

************************************************************************************

Gameplay:
Goal: Capture the flag.
    Do we want a single flag - or multiple units like gold pieces?
Turn based - everyone makes a move, and once everyone has submitted the server returns a result

Map:
Real valued positions
Flag is hidden somewhere.
Do we want islands - limit the places to hide the flag?
Do we want to add other obstacles, such as sea monsters later?

Ships:
Can move some distance per day.
Can specify a patrol or a path for the ship to take.

Ships have an amount of health
health affects how far ships can move/how much damage they can do

Ships path determined by drawing it on the sceen?
Can a path be canceled if a turn lands part way through it?

Fighting:
Ships have a number of fighting 'dice'
Larger ships have more dice.
health affects number of dice.

Low health ships can be captured.

Risk/CIV style fighting - first encounter automatic - one attack each when they meet.
Then players have a choice - run or attack.

Game start:
Each player given regions where they can set their flags and ships to start

Is flag location fixed?  or can it be moved by the player by ship during gameplay?

Game end:
You capture the enemies flag and bring it safely back to your base/flag
