We should put our ideas about what we want to do and how we want to make it here.

************************************************************************************

Testing

Gameplay:
    Goal: Sink all enemy ships - Basic Battleship
    Players take turn picking a point in the enemy space. That point explodes. Any ship in the radius takes damage.


Map:
    Real valued positions

    perhaps one for each player containing their ships, perhaps either another for their attacks, but I think we just use an overlay. -- For later version, we might want to include multiple opponents.

    Viewed through a camera view.
        Will enable us to target any size screen.
        enables panning, and zoom

Ships:
    When hit, a portion of their ship is "covered" by the explosion. That part becomes damage. When some percent of the ship is damaged, the ship dies. You cannot damage the same portion twice.

    ships are static.
    They are placed at the beginning of the game.


Turn:
    Start by showing the player what happened before the turn. i.e. shots fired, ships hit/sunk
    Show the player the targeting board.
        -- inlcude past shots here. Player should be able to see misses and hits.
    Allow the player to Fire some number of shots at opponent
    Pass turn to other player

Firing:
    Select a spot.
    Explosion.
    If the explosion makes contact with an enemy ship, the explosion is marked.
        I think we want to mark the entire explosion.
        I dont think we want to inform the player about how much was hit or what was hit. Just that it was.
    Turn switches to other player.
        -- We might consider allowing multiple shots per turn.

Multiplayer:
    Use Gamecenter API to pass turns online.
    We will need a Match object to describe the current game.
    On their turn, a player will download the Match object, update it with their turn, and push it back.
        We might want to use a similar approach for offline to make things consistent in the code.

    Player can potentially be playing multiple games at once.

Game start:
    Each player must place all of their ships


Game end:
    A player's ships are all destroyed


Money:
    iAds
    I think we should either put a banner in the game, or display a full screen ad every so many rounds. Something small to earn a little bit of money from, but nothing too annoying.
